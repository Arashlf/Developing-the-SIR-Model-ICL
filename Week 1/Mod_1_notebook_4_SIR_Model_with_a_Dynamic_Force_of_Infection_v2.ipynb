However, in the previous model, we made the unrealistic assumption that the force of infection can be expressed as a constant rate. As you have just learnt, in reality $\\lambda$ changes over time, depending on the number of infected people in the population. This is what we are looking at in this etivity! \n",

Our assumptions for the initial conditions ($S = 999999$, $I = 1$ and $R = 0$), simulation period (60 days) and $\\gamma$ (0.1 days$^{-1}$) remain the same as in the previous etivity, and the daily infection rate $\\beta$ equals 1.\n",

To make this easier, we have written a function that allows you to plot the model output by entering different combinations of parameters. Run the example below, using the same parameter values as your model above, and check that your output was correct. If not, you should first go back to your code to see if you can find your mistake.\n",
