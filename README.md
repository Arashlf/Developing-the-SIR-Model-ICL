# Developing-the-SIR-Model-ICL

First Course of Infectious Disease Modelling Specialization from Imperial College London. This course will introduce some of the basic concepts in building compartmental models, including how to interpret and represent rates, durations and proportions. You'll learn to place the mathematics to one side and concentrate on gaining intuition into the behaviour of a simple epidemic, and be introduced to further basic concepts of infectious disease epidemiology, such as the  basic reproduction number (R0) and its implications for infectious disease dynamics. To express the mathematical  underpinnings of the  basic drivers that you study, you'll use the simple SIR model, which, in turn, will help you examine different scenarios for reproduction numbers. Susceptibility to infection is the fuel for an infectious  disease, so understanding  the dynamics of susceptibility can offer important insights into epidemic dynamics, as well as priorities for control.
